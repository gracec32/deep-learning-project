# Low-Light Image Enhancement in Different Color Spaces

**Author:** Grace Choi

**Course:** MIT 6.7960 Final Project

## Overview

This project explores **low-light image enhancement (LLIE)** using alternative color spaces
instead of the standard RGB representation. The goal is to determine whether transforming images
into different color spaces can improve image quality in dark or low-visibility conditions.

The project builds on a previous SOTA (state-of-the-art) model and introduces
**color transformations** combined with a **cross-attention mechanism**. This approach
aims to enhance image brightness while reducing blur and noise in low-light images.
